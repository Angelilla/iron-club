Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Can I get a free trial before I purchase?

Yes. Anyone with a Nintendo Account can get one free, seven-day trial through Nintendo eShop on Nintendo Switch.

During the free trial, you’ll have access to benefits including online play in compatible games, a selection of NES™ games with newly added online play, and more!

Free trial automatically converts into a 1-month membership for $3.99/month, unless you turn off automatic renewal before the end of the free trial.



How do I purchase a membership for Nintendo Switch Online?

Nintendo Switch Online memberships are available for purchase on Nintendo.com, in Nintendo eShop on your Nintendo Switch system, and through select retailers.



Will membership plans be charged automatically?

No, Nintendo Switch owners won’t automatically become members, so they will need to purchase an Individual or Family Membership in order to avoid disruption of their online play in compatible games.

If I buy additional Nintendo Switch Online memberships while I already have an active membership, what happens to the remaining time on my active membership?

If you have an active Individual Membership and purchase another one, the new subscription term will be added to the time remaining on your current term.

For example, if you have 35 days remaining on your Individual Membership and buy a 365-day Individual Membership, your remaining subscription term will now be 400 days. You can add Individual Memberships up to a total term of three years.

Note that you cannot combine Family Memberships and Individual Memberships



Can I change from an Individual Membership to a Family Membership?

You can purchase a Family Membership and set it for automatic renewal even if you have an active Individual Membership. This will turn off automatic renewal for your Individual Membership.

However, your subscription terms won't be combined; your Individual Membership will remain active until the end of its term.



What is the difference between an Individual Membership and a Family Membership?

Individual Memberships allow one Nintendo Account holder access to the Nintendo Switch Online service. They are available in 1-month, 3-month, and 12-month increments.

Family Memberships give up to eight Nintendo Account holders access to the Nintendo Switch Online service for a 12-month period.

If you have more than one person to share the plan with, you can save on the total cost of the annual membership per person.  The more people in your family group, the more you’ll save.

As the purchaser of a Family Membership, you will need to be at least 18 years old and save your credit card or link your PayPal account to your Nintendo Account via Nintendo eShop.



If I own multiple Nintendo Switch systems, will I need a separate membership for each one?

If I purchase a Family Membership, how do my family members access the Nintendo Switch Online service?


You can set up a family group of up to eight total Nintendo Accounts via your Nintendo Account settings. That way, everyone in your family group can use the Nintendo Switch Online service.
